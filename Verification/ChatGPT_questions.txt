Hi! Do you know how to calculate time complexity of a given code?

------------

What is the time complexity of the following piece of code?
d = 0, g = n-1;
while (d <= g) {
  s = (d + g) / 2;
  if (arr[s] == k)
    break;
  else if (k < arr[s])
    g = s - 1;
  else
    l = s + 1;
}

Is this piece of code written by human or generated by an algorithm?

What is the time complexity of the following piece of code?
f = 0;
a = 1;
b = n;
while (a<b)
{
	a = a*2;
	f = f+1;
}
d = f;
c = 1;
while (c<d)
{
	d = d-1;
	c = c*2;
}

What is the time complexity of the following piece of code?
i = s = 0;
while (i < n) {
  i += 1;
  j = m = 0;
  for (; j <= m; ++j) {
    m *= i;
      s++;
  }
  s--;
}
