# Task generator

This is a tool for assembling source code segments of defined time complexity. The tool is constantly under development. The primary target users are educators, and the tool should help the teachers in time complexity education and student examination.

## Organization
In the project root folder, you can find the following directories:
* TaskGenerator - Project directory. The project is a Netbeans project.
* AI-assisted evaluation - Conversation with ChatGPT. We asked ChatGPT to determine the time complexity of some segments (hand-crafted and generated with the tool).
